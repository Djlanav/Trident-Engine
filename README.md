# Trident Engine

Trident Engine is a 3D game engine that uses OpenGL as a rendering backend. I plan on utilizing tech such as Binary Space Partitioning (BSP) for making maps and Lua for scripting. 
The engine will be modular so in essence you'll have:

* A program for map creation/editing
* Another for scripting
* The engine itself

The engine itself will have the code to load up BSP maps and Lua scripts and will be where a game actually "runs" :)
